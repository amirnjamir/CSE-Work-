    "I missed a small mistake in which i left a colon which gave me a synatx error. For Question 4, define a class named employee using the init method to get the names lined up. Secondly, the initialization takes place which eventually leads to the string representation which makes it easier to print the details of each employee. You then create three objects of the 'Employee' class, that each represents an employee with their name, ID #, their department, and job title. Ultimately you simply print the details. "

    "At first I had a small minor spelling mistake but that was quickly fixed if you look atr the snagit video. Pretty much the same thing for Question 4 (I used it as a sort of outline once I fot the hang of it): First we define a class named :RetailItem and uses an __init__ item to describe  its different sets(or topics) like \"description, units, and price\". That same method(init) sets the values for each instance of the 'RetailItem' class when something new is created. We then use the idea of string representation, whic really just makes it easier to print the details of each invdivdual item. Furthermore, we create three 'items' of the 'RetailItem' Class, that each have their own description. Lastly we print out each item one by one on a new line to make it look more clean "
